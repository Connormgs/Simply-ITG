*****OPENITG AND 3.95 ONLY*****
*****SM5 IS NOT COMPATIBLE*****

The goal of this theme is to port the functionality of Simply Love to the default In The Groove 2 theme we all know and love.

Credits to Mad Matt and hurtpiggypig for Simply Love and creating the tools that I took from this theme.  
Gabrimax98 for color switcher implementations and tweaks/fixes to the look of the theme.
iund for lots of functionality help and seemingly having answers to everything. 
Adam Kirby for lots of testing and being a true ITG diehard. 

Features 3.95 SL doesn't have:

If you hold the start button during a song you can restart it!

(OITG) M-Mods and they work with the rate adjust feature!

Centered mod lets you move your receptors up/down in real time!

notes: 

Theme doesn't seem to have JWA cuz of this in metrics.ini:

JejWindowAdd=0.0015

If you want JWA change this to:

JudgeWindowAdd=0.0015
