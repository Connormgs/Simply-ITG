*****OPENITG AND 3.95 ONLY*****
*****SM5 IS NOT COMPATIBLE*****

The goal of this theme is to port the functionality of Simply Love to the default In The Groove 2 theme we all know and love.

Credits to Mad Matt for Simply Love and creating the tools that I took from his theme.  
Gabrimax98 for color switcher implementations and tweaks/fixes to the look of the theme.
iund for lots of functionality help and seemingly having answers to everything. 
Adam Kirby for lots of testing and being a true ITG diehard.
